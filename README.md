# Pabandi - Agentic AI Booking Ecosystem

> **Official Entrant: Alibaba CoCreate 2026 Pitch Competition**
> 
> Pabandi is positioned for the "Agentic Business" track, demonstrating how AI agents can autonomously manage front-desk operations, predict no-shows, and secure revenue for SMEs globally.

Pabandi is an Agentic AI booking ecosystem built for the modern service economy. For businesses, our autonomous AI agent actively protects your bottom line by predicting no-shows and negotiating dynamic, risk-based deposits. For customers, we offer a seamless booking journey powered by a next-generation Web3 loyalty program. Arrive for your appointment, and you earn PAB tokens—digital assets that hold real value, redeemable for future services or transferable to your personal crypto wallet.

## 🎯 Features

- **Translucent Neony Design**: A highly premium, frosted-glass interface featuring a dark slate base, high-blur glass surfaces, and glowing neon accents (cyan, mint, pink) for maximum modern appeal.
- **Solana Web3 Integration**: Native Solana blockchain integration. Users automatically earn **Pabandi Reliability Tokens (PAB)** dropped directly to their Phantom/Solflare wallets for every successful booking and check-in.
- **AI Reliability Score**: Proprietary ML models analyze user booking histories, location context, and time variables to generate a dynamic "no-show risk score." High-risk users are dynamically prompted for upfront deposits.
- **Seamless Maps Integration**: Integrated Google Maps embedded directly into the marketing site and reservation dashboards to discover and visualize real-time local business data.
- **Business Management**: Complete business registration, webhook integrations, and native CRM synchronization (Odoo JSON-RPC and Cal.com).
- **Enterprise API & SDK**: Full Pay-As-You-Go developer API with a native `@pabandi/sdk` for Node.js/TypeScript, allowing drop-in access to the Trust Matrix and Solana Escrow.
- **Customer Experience**: Dedicated portals for customers to track bookings, manage their Pabandi Web3 Wallet, and earn crypto rewards for reliable behavior
- **Payment Integration**: Secure fiat processing via **Stripe** (US cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay) with **Safepay** retained as a secondary gateway, plus native **Web3 Crypto Payments**
- **Automated Reminders**: SMS and email notifications to reduce no-shows
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into booking patterns, revenue, and crypto rewards

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for no-show prediction models
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication & Google/Facebook OAuth
- **Payments**: Safepay (Fiat) & Ethers.js/Solana Web3.js (Crypto)
- **Notifications**: Twilio SMS + SendGrid Email + Outbound Webhooks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for caching and sessions)

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Set up environment variables
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed initial data (optional)
npm run seed

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- **Public site (Firebase)**: [https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/](https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/)
- Frontend app (local dev): http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Deploy the public marketing site

The live site is hosted on Firebase project **pabandi-42c5b** from the `site/` folder:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the dashboard app into `site/app/` and deploys the marketing site + app to Firebase.

**Required on Cloud Run** (API server): set `FRONTEND_URL=https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/app` so Google/Facebook OAuth redirects back correctly.

Preview locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run site
```

- **Data Protection**: Aligned with CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and GDPR-like rights
- **Payment Security**: PCI-DSS compliant payment processing via Stripe
- **GDPR-like Features**: User data rights and privacy controls

## 🤖 Agentic AI Features

The platform deploys an autonomous AI agent to:
- Predict no-show probability for each reservation
- Calculate a real-time risk score based on customer reliability, weather, time, and historical data
- Automatically negotiate and enforce dynamic deposit amounts (via Safepay/Stripe) for high-risk bookings
- Identify patterns in booking behavior to optimize table turnover autonomously

## 💰 Payments & Crypto Ecosystem

Pabandi features a dual-payment architecture:
1. **Stripe Integration**: Handles standard fiat transactions for the US market — credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Deposits are captured via Stripe Checkout Sessions.
2. **Safepay Integration** *(Pakistan market)*: Retained as a secondary gateway supporting local Pakistani payment methods (Credit/Debit, JazzCash).
3. **Web3 Crypto Wallet**: Customers can connect their MetaMask (BNB Smart Chain) or Phantom (Solana) wallets to the platform. They earn `$PAB` token rewards for successful check-ins and verified Google reviews, driving loyalty through decentralized incentives.
