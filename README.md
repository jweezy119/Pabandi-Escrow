# Pabandi - AI-Powered Reservation System

Pabandi is an AI-powered booking ecosystem built for the modern service economy. For businesses, we actively protect your bottom line by using AI to predict no-shows and secure revenue upfront with dynamic, risk-based deposits. For customers, we offer a seamless booking journey powered by a next-generation Web3 loyalty program. Arrive for your appointment, and you earn PAB tokens—digital assets that hold real value, redeemable for future services or transferable to your personal crypto wallet.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for caching and sessions)

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Set up environment variables
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed initial data (optional)
npm run seed

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- **Public site (Firebase)**: [https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/](https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/)
- Frontend app (local dev): http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Deploy the public marketing site

The live site is hosted on Firebase project **pabandi-42c5b** from the `site/` folder:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the dashboard app into `site/app/` and deploys the marketing site + app to Firebase.

**Required on Cloud Run** (API server): set `FRONTEND_URL=https://pabandi-42c5b.web.app/app` so Google/Facebook OAuth redirects back correctly.

Preview locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run site
```
