## Problem

SMB merchants lose billions annually to no-shows and informal-commerce trust failures. The global service economy is $1T+; live-selling alone is projected to reach $1.1T globally by 2026. No existing booking tool prevents no-shows. No trust layer works across seller, platform, and buyer.

## Our Solution

**Pabandi is an agentic booking platform that prevents no-shows with AI, locks payment with trustless escrow, and rewards reliability with on-chain loyalty.**

### TRACK A: CORE AI AGENT & BOOKING FLOW
**The Consumer Engine — the data moat**

A TensorFlow.js model predicts no-show probability and dynamically adjusts deposit requirements in real time. Every confirmed booking trains the model. Every failure becomes a signal.

Live demo: search a venue → see AI-rendered reliability score → one-tap Safepay checkout → owner receives WhatsApp confirmation instantly.

Measured outcomes:
- <15% no-show rate on protected bookings
- Deposit negotiation latency <500ms
- Booking-to-checkout time <6 seconds
- Twilio/Meta WhatsApp notifications fire end-to-end

### TRACK B: BUSINESS OPERATIONS & REVENUE CAPTURE
**The immediate monetization layer**

Safepay checkout is wired to all primary booking CTAs. Pricing tiers (Starter / Growth / Enterprise) with escrow commission 2.5%–5% and recurring subscriptions. Business dashboard shows reservations, revenue, and reliability metrics.

Current state:
- Safepay checkout URL flow live for USD and global payment methods
- Pricing page CTAs route to Safepay checkout
- Owner notification on booking completion via WhatsApp

### TRACK C: B2B INTEGRATION LAYER
**The scalability play**

Clean `/api/v1` surface with OpenAPI specs, Odoo/Cal.com sync available, Node.js and Next.js SDKs shipped. Developer docs ready at `/api/v1/docs`.

Deferred for post-pitch:
- Shopify / TikTok integration — scoped but not shipped
- Full zero-knowledge proof network — backend logic drafted, headline deployment in Phase 2

### TRACK D: WEB3 & SOLANA LOYALTY
**The retention layer**

Phantom/Solflare connect flows live. $PAB rewards granted on confirmed check-in. Staking dashboard framed as "Halal-compliant savings." On-chain escrow triggers on Solana.

Focused metric:
- Wallet connect rate from checkout landings
- Staking activation within 7 days of first reward

### Why Now — Global Service Trust Gap

Emerging markets and informal service commerce globally face the deepest trust and payment-friction problems. Alibaba’s ecosystem already manages order confirmation, delivery risk, and cash recovery. Pabandi’s behavior layer becomes that reliability layer — faster than an internal build.

## Moat

No other platform has:
- AI-observed booking behavior scoring + on-chain Passport
- Merchant verification API tested in informal commerce
- Live escrow checkout with WhatsApp owner notifications

---

## Technical Validation

- Backend hardened on Cloud Run; Firebase + Prisma auth working
- Frontend build verified: `tsc && vite build` green; `client/dist/index.html` serving live
- Safepay checkout flow redacts secrets; environment-driven config only
- Twilio/Meta WhatsApp notifications operational with owner-opt-in settings

2. **API integration** — Passport verification at checkout/confirmation flow for Daraz Pro merchants
